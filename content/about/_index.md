As a Principal Ad-Tech Consultant at Amazon Advertising, I specialize in integration scenarios within international environments. My work centers on deconstructing and optimizing systems and processes. With a background in Natural Sciences and a strong interest in technology, I have built my career at the intersection of analytical thinking and IT solutions.

I live near Berlin with my family. When not working, I enjoy gardening and hands-on projects around the house. I also maintain an open-source project monitoring Lake Constance water levels at [pegel-konstanz.de](https://www.pegel-konstanz.de).
