I am a data-driven Program Manager with leadership experience who has a background in consulting, and programmatic advertising. Deconstructing and improving processes is one of my passions. A great interest in IT has accompanied my entire career.

Outside of work, the focus is on family. With two boys, we live outside of Berlin. I enjoy gardening and any sort of tinkering around our house. I am always up for something new. Just recently, our boys got me into skateboarding.
