## New Website: pegel-konstanz.de

As a tangible outcome of my data analytics mentorship, I created website [pegel-konstanz.de](https://www.pegel-konstanz.de/en/index.html). The focus on this website will be on individual analyses of the water level of Lake Constance (Bodensee). But first, I had to get the table stakes functionality right. You cannot discuss the level of the lake without also providing the current level. And that was a lot more work than I expected it to be. But it was and is a great learning experience to support a data pipeline with date and time zone sensitive information.

You can find more information about my motivation and the technical setup in the About section: https://www.pegel-konstanz.de/en/03_about/index.html
