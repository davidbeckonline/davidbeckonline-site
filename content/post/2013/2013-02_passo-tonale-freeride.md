For the last four days I have been to Ponte di Legno in Lombardy, Italy. I went there with the DAV Friedrichshafen in order to go freeriding in and around Andamello at the Passo Tonale.

Even though we decided not to go skiing today because it was snowing and the visibility was pretty bad, I would say we were lucky with the weather conditions overall. The forecast was rather bad.  In the end we had three out of four days with powder, some sun and great alpine adventures.

I guess some pictures are the best way to give you an impression of what it was like.
