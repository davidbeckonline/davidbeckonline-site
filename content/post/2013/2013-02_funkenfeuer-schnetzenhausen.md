It took me more than four years in Friedrichshafen to go to the so called "Funkenfeuer". This bonfire tradition just seems to be restricted to the swabian part of lake constance. At least, I never experienced it on the west side of the lake.

Brass music (including "Die Fischerin vom Bodensee"), Bratwurst, Most, snow and fire... that's probably as german as it can get. 

A nice tradition.
