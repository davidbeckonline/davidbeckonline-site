What a great weekend.

On saturday I joined the DAV group for a little skitour at the Ochsenlager near Hittisau. On sunday I got the chance to go ice skating near Reichanau. As the weather forecast ist predicting warm weather for the next days, I had to take this change even though it wasn't much ice. But it is always worth it.
