I thought the skiing season was over, but as the spring has not yet arrived, me and my flatmates decided to head to St. Anton Austria to enjoy winter.

This was the first time for me to go skiing in April, I think.

Lesson leared: The sun is quite intense in April. You should use sunscreen, otherwise you might look like an owl or reccoon when you get back to work on monday. ;o)
