A few weeks ago I was told that there would be a lot of crayfish around the Island Reichenau within Lake Constance. The population seems to have grown massively in recent years. Many residents do not know anything yet. So I went out to see if I could one of them. I wasn't successful during daytime, but at night it was pretty easy.

To demonstrate my flatmate my hunting abilities, I even shot a little video of it.

@J: Impressive, eh?!

The crayfish in this video was about 10 cm long.

To avoid misunderstandings: "No Animals Were Harmed in the Making of This Film". 

This also applies to myself.
