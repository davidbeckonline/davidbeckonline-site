Reinhold Messner apparently does not get tired of telling the world that the "Dolomiti" (Dolomites) are the most beautiful mountains of whole world. And this guy without a doubt, has seen a lot.

However, it was a beautiful day. Saturday skiing the whole day long. On Sunday I was practicing some backcountry skiing. About 1050m upwards in about three hours was enough for me after some weeks with the focus on relaxing.
