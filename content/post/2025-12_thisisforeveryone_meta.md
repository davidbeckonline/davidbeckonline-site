## Tim Berners-Lee: "This is for everyone"

I recently read "This is for everyone" by Tim Berners-Lee. This book is a very good reminder about how we got to 'the internet'. Why did Tim Berners-Lee develop the World Wide Web. And which decision did lead to this beatiful thing that we take for granted today? I especially enjoyed it to read about this topic in the light of all the recent AI developments. Will the web as we know it die? Is it still worth having a blog? What would fundamental models be trained on if there wasn't a human created internet anymore?
Great questions in an interesting time.

I need this picture for a little multi-meta layer post, I am working on.
