**I recently watched "Spiritual Letters - The Art of Mr. Paradox Paradise". That was an interesting experience on different levels.**

As the movie title ‘Spiritual Letters’ indicates, this movie is about letters, but also about the spiritual journey of artist Mr. Paradox Paradise. Furthermore, this movie was my first application of crypto currencies and what some people call Web3. This blog post will be structured accordingly.

You can find the movie trailer on YouTube.

# LETTERS

The movie 'Spiritual Letters’' was directed, edited, and is about Berlin based artist Mr. Paradox Paradise. It covers his work between 2018 and 2021. Known also as a member of graffiti crew 'Berlin Kidz', Mr. Paradox Paradise became known for his Pichação style along house facades.
Personally, I was never a fan of the mentioned [Pichação](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Picha%C3%A7%C3%A3o) style. But I started to like the unique calligraphy Mr. Paradox Paradise developed. While this graffiti type originated from Sao Paulo is typically very rough and angular, Mr. Paradox Paradise developed a soft and floating style for his letters.

On first sight, people might think that all of Mr. Paradox Paradise lettering looks the same. And yes, there are repeating elements. On the house facades, the letters are usually blue and red in color. The words are 'Paradox' and 'Paradise'. These letters are typically supplemented by little messages, to which we will get later in this article. Despite the repetitiveness, it is important to note that every letter is unique. Below is an example of the letter "R" taken from different pieces.

Besides the letters itself, the 'where' and 'how' is an element of the art of Mr. Paradox Paradise. The locations are spectacular. Even if he was allowed to paint his art legally, it is breathtaking to see him abseil from rooftops - and even more spectacular a windmill. 
And how does he even get there? In the movie, the artist describes how he developed the necessary skills to manipulate locks over many years.

Besides house facades, we see the artist doing ground calligraphy. You can find some of these pieces on satellite images. Here are a two examples from Google Maps:

1/ Oberbaumstraße & Bevernstraße (52°30'04.6"N 13°26'33.6"E)

2/ Kottbusser Damm & Urbanstraße (52°29'17.85"N 13°25'28.47"E)

<iframe src="https://www.google.com/maps/embed?pb=!1m18!1m12!1m3!1d372.4248700288548!2d13.42424218828465!3d52.48840520283304!2m3!1f0!2f0!3f0!3m2!1i1024!2i768!4f13.1!3m3!1m2!1s0x0%3A0x5228db7424c67e0c!2zNTLCsDI5JzE3LjkiTiAxM8KwMjUnMjguNSJF!5e1!3m2!1sde!2sde!4v1645258315203!5m2!1sde!2sde" width="600" height="450" style="border:0;" allowfullscreen="" loading="lazy"></iframe>

All of the actions across Germany's capital city Berlin are documented in detail and with spectacular drone footage. Apparently, a lot of this drone footage was taken by Mr. Paradox Paradise himself. In the movie, the artist mentions that he crashed drones worth about 25k EUR to learn this skill. We see him building and soldering his own razing drones, the so-called ‘Paradox Drone 3.0’. For me personally, this movie contains the most spectacular drone footage I have ever seen.

What else is there? We see the artist creating 3D models of his letters. We see him surfing - on waves, on trains, and on a bus.

Of course, most of the action we see is illegal. The face of the Mr. Paradox Paradise is always covered by a mask or obfuscated - in many cases both. I imagine that it is a lot of work to obfuscate the face in every image. His voice is always distorted. Still, it feels as if the artist wants us to get as close to him as somehow possible for the artform he chose.


# SPIRITUAL

At the very beginning of the movie, Mr. Paradox Paradise states:

> ***“This lifestyle is my painkiller to the damage my soul has to carry.”*** (1’15s)

And with that, he takes us with him on his spiritual journey.

I would say that this film is as much about the art of Mr. Paradox Paradise as of the personal development of the artist behind this mask. Throughout the movie, it sounds as if he is exhausted by his own actions. But there are these messages that he wants us to read. While the capital letters PARADOX and PARADISE repeat, there are always accompanying messages. Mostly in written form, sometimes also symbolized by a figure, such as a dove. Here are some of the messages we can read:

> *“I paint for Freedom and Awareness”* (43’21)

> *“Spread Love, not Fear”* (16’20)

> *“Your Thoughts are the Architects of your Destiny”* (47’16)

> *“If you dont control your Mind, someone else will”*

> *“Its hard to see the Truth for programmed People”* (68’50)

> *“Paradise is not a Place, its a State Consciousness”* (48’)

> *“Stars cant shine without Darkness”* (57'50)

> *“I hope we find true Peace one Day”* (70’37)


Referring to the last quote, the artist indicates that he found his peace in surfing. We see him - sometimes even with a mask on - shredding the waves of Costa Rica. It is fascinating to see how this contrast to the city life seems to relax him. The letters we see him painting on paper and walls in central america seem more rounded and fluid.

That being said, Mr. Paradox Paradise also communicates beliefs which a general public would probably consider conspiracy theories. He believes in aliens and elements of the QAnon group. He points out so-called ‘truth seekers’ like ufologist [Steven M. Greer](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Steven_M._Greer) and Author [David Icke](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/David_Icke). According to Wikipedia, the ladder is accused of being antisemitic. I cannot judge this. At this point, I just want to make clear that I distance myself from any antisemetic ideas and holocoust denial.  
Mr. Paradox Paradise is self-thought. He is critical of the school system and would like to see children practicing meditation.

What fascinated me about this movie and Mr. Paradox Paradise throughout this movie, is the immense accumulation of talent in one person. There is this radical artform itself - the painting and the abseil. But then we see him manipulating locks, where he is building his own tools. He customizes his own drones and performs drone flights which remind me of drone racing. And then there is the IT part. His phone looks as if it was encrypted with a custom android ROM. As previously mentioned, he directed and edited the movie. And that seems very professional to me. I really enjoyed how the pictures and the music works together. A list of all tracks is given at the end of this post. It is difficult for me to rate the difficulty of train and bus surfing, but Mr. Paradox Paradise's skateboarding and surfing skills are certainly outstanding. We see him performing a skateboard trick - might be an impossible flip - on a half-pipe shaped rooftop that most skaters will never be able to perform in a skatepark. He shapes and designs his own beautiful surfboards.
That being said, he chose this artform and life. With this skill set, he would also be successful if he wasn’t an artist.

At the end of the film, Mr. Paradox Paradise mentions that he is now ready to sell his art in galleries. I hope this will make him happy. Good luck.


# CRYPTO

With the content described above, it is obvious that freedom and anonymity are elemental for Mr. Paradox Paradise. In that spirit, the film is embedded in a Web3 experience. For me personally, watching this movie was the first real live application of Cryptocurrencies. The website spiritual-letters.com can be connected with a crypto wallet. Per recommendation of the website, I used Metamask for this purpose. A minimum donation of 0.04 BNB (about 14 EUR as of today) is required to watch the movie. Now BNB, short for Binance Coin, can only be purchased on crypto exchange Binance. So fiat money needs to be converted to Binance Coin. Then, the BNBs must be transferred to the Metamask wallet in your browser. When visiting spiritual-letters.com, the website can be connected to the wallet. As soon as the money transfer is approved on the blockchain the movie trailer on the website is replaced with the 72 minutes long movie.
I enjoyed this experiment. The user journey is rather complicated. I guess this is the reason why the artist also added a [video instruction](
https://youtu.be/fcVClr2-fXg) on YouTube just recently. However, it felt ‘new’ for me and it fit well to the movie itself.

# Appendix


### Artist Web Presence

> **Website**: [Spiritual Letters](https://spiritual-letters.com/)

> **Twitter**: [@paradox_letters](https://twitter.com/Paradox_Letters)

> **Instagram**: [mr.paradox.paradise](https://www.instagram.com/mr.paradox.paradise) I think the artist ist most active on Instagram, which is a remarkable choice. All products of 'Meta' are the definition of a 'walled garden'. It contradicts to the idea of freedom, in my opinion. If you do not have an account, you cannot check his content - at least not in detail. However, I learned that there are website which help to overcome this barrier. Just mirroring the Instragram content to Twitter would at least make it more accessible.

### More Videos

This video is from French-German television station ARTE. It gives a very good overview of the movie. I would almost argue that it covers too much.
