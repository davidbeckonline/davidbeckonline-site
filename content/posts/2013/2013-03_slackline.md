Today I was slacklining for the first time within probably more then three years.

As I still feel a little bit weak due the flew which caught me after the trip to Italy last week, this was the perfect choice to spend the afternoon:

Mild temperatures, sunlight, ... spring is definitely arriving. I had some great days in the snow this season, so I can confidently say "Goodbye winter - welcome spring".

The slackline set I bought is produced by [Slackline-Tools](http://www.slackline-tools.de/startseite/), a company from Konstanz. To be honest, I was hoping that the pulley concept would have been improved somehow. I am afraid that the ribbon will suffer the same way it did in my own construction. However, it worked out. And I am pretty happy that a break of several years does not mean you have to start from scratch again.
