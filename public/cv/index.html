I am a data-driven Program Manager with leadership experience and a background in consulting, as well as programmatic advertising. Deconstructing and improving processes is one of my passions. A great interest in IT has determined my professional career.
Outside of work, the focus is on family. With two boys, we live outside of Berlin. I enjoy gardening and any sort of tinkering around our house. I am always up for something new. Just recently, our boys got me into skateboarding.">
